# Tree of Thought
Repository for all my projects associated with [https://www.treeofthought.com](https://www.treeofthought.com) _even_ if that association is just aspirational and in my head.

## Usage
Note, when cloning a repository the default provided by github.com is `git@github.com:treeofthought/<repo-name>.git`. In this default, replace `github.com` with the "Host" that maps the SSH key you're using for repository access. (`github-treeofthought` in my case)

## TODO
* Set up SSH key for this email address to simplify multiple git users
* Migrate website here
  * React app first
* Add world record project 
* Secure the repositories so only I can contribute even though they're world viewable.
